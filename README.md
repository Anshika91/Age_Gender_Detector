# Age_Gender_Detector

Simple age and gender detector using Machine learning
The Age and Gender Detector project is an innovative application that utilizes advanced computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to determine the approximate age and gender of individuals from images or video streams. It is designed to provide real-time analysis and accurate predictions, offering valuable insights for various fields such as marketing, customer profiling, security systems, and demographic analysis.
The project combines the power of deep learning models and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract relevant facial features and make accurate predictions about age and gender. The CNN model is trained on extensive datasets containing labeled images of individuals across different age groups and genders. This training process enables the model to learn and recognize patterns and characteristics that are indicative of age and gender.
